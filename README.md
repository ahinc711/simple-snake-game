# Simple Snake Game
Playing around with creating a Snake game in JavaScript, for practice.
Goal is to use webpack to run this as a server, with hot module reloading to make development fast.
Following webpack guide: https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/

## Setup
- Install NodeJS/npm
- Run `npm install` to install webpack and dependencies

## Build
If you only want to build the source, run `npm run build`. This will generate files in the dist folder.

## Run
- Run `npm run serve` to start the server
- Browse to the localhost endpoint mentioned in the output
